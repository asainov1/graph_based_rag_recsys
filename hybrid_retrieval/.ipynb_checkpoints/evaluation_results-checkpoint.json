The right to award doctorates, granted to ETH in 1909, was an important milestone in encouraging research in the agricultural sciences.

Another 67 years would pass before Silvia Dorn was elected Full Professor of Agricultural Sciences and Food Science at ETH Zurich in 1992. All the same, ETH\u2019s first agricultural scientists were unable to make any great progress. Although the Division of Agriculture was allotted 12 percent of ETH\u2019s budget at the time, in 1871 this amounted to a mere 35,000 Swiss francs. The right to award doctorates, granted to ETH in 1909, was an important milestone in encouraging research in the agricultural sciences. As a result, in 1913, the first agricultural doctoral thesis on the \u201cPhysical properties of the equine hoof horn\u201d made it into the history books. Emmanuel Frossard, Professor of Plant Nutrition at ETH since 1994, describes the early days of agricultural research as \u201cinvariably creative. It was conducted at an outstanding level. This made it possible to train young researchers who, in turn, had a formative influence on generations of academics.\u201d Despite a slow start, the subject area soon made great headway. Meanwhile, the former Department of Agriculture was constantly being restructured. Along with Frossard, Michael Kreuzer, Professor of Animal Nutrition, has the longest tenure",

Another 67 years would pass before Silvia Dorn was elected Full Professor of Agricultural Sciences and Food Science at ETH Zurich in 1992. All the same, ETH\u2019s first agricultural scientists were unable to make any great progress. Although the Division of Agriculture was allotted 12 percent of ETH\u2019s budget at the time, in 1871 this amounted to a mere 35,000 Swiss francs. The right to award doctorates, granted to ETH in 1909, was an important milestone in encouraging research in the agricultural sciences. As a result, in 1913, the first agricultural doctoral thesis on the \u201cPhysical properties of the equine hoof horn\u201d made it into the history books. Emmanuel Frossard, Professor of Plant Nutrition at ETH since 1994, describes the early days of agricultural research as \u201cinvariably creative. It was conducted at an outstanding level. This made it possible to train young researchers who, in turn, had a formative influence on generations of academics.\u201d Despite a slow start, the subject area soon made great headway. Meanwhile, the former Department of Agriculture was constantly being restructured. Along with Frossard, Michael Kreuzer, Professor of Animal Nutrition, has the longest tenure",

Another 67 years would pass before Silvia Dorn was elected Full Professor of Agricultural Sciences and Food Science at ETH Zurich in 1992. All the same, ETH\u2019s first agricultural scientists were unable to make any great progress. Although the Division of Agriculture was allotted 12 percent of ETH\u2019s budget at the time, in 1871 this amounted to a mere 35,000 Swiss francs. The right to award doctorates, granted to ETH in 1909, was an important milestone in encouraging research in the agricultural sciences. As a result, in 1913, the first agricultural doctoral thesis on the \u201cPhysical properties of the equine hoof horn\u201d made it into the history books. Emmanuel Frossard, Professor of Plant Nutrition at ETH since 1994, describes the early days of agricultural research as \u201cinvariably creative. It was conducted at an outstanding level. This made it possible to train young researchers who, in turn, had a formative influence on generations of academics.\u201d Despite a slow start, the subject area soon made great headway. Meanwhile, the former Department of Agriculture was constantly being restructured. Along with Frossard, Michael Kreuzer, Professor of Animal Nutrition, has the longest tenure",

Another 67 years would pass before Silvia Dorn was elected Full Professor of Agricultural Sciences and Food Science at ETH Zurich in 1992. All the same, ETH\u2019s first agricultural scientists were unable to make any great progress. Although the Division of Agriculture was allotted 12 percent of ETH\u2019s budget at the time, in 1871 this amounted to a mere 35,000 Swiss francs. The right to award doctorates, granted to ETH in 1909, was an important milestone in encouraging research in the agricultural sciences. As a result, in 1913, the first agricultural doctoral thesis on the \u201cPhysical properties of the equine hoof horn\u201d made it into the history books. Emmanuel Frossard, Professor of Plant Nutrition at ETH since 1994, describes the early days of agricultural research as \u201cinvariably creative. It was conducted at an outstanding level. This made it possible to train young researchers who, in turn, had a formative influence on generations of academics.\u201d Despite a slow start, the subject area soon made great headway. Meanwhile, the former Department of Agriculture was constantly being restructured. Along with Frossard, Michael Kreuzer, Professor of Animal Nutrition, has the longest tenure",

The Professor of Seismology and Geophysics coordinates the activities at ETH for the InSight mission. Seismic signals recorded on Mars are relatively quiet and and therefore difficult to assess. Do they come from the wind? Were they a result of meteorite collisions? Or, are they in fact caused by geological processes inside the planet? Researchers at the ETH Marsquake Service have interpreted a seismic event that reached Earth on 6 April 2019 as a possible marsquake.",

Not much has happened on Mars since then, while plate tectonics have caused dramatic changes in the surface of Earth. Mars shows us what Earth may have looked like some 3.5 billion years ago. Why is that crucial in unravelling the origin of life? It\u2019s important because that is when it is assumed that life began on Earth \u2013 perhaps on Mars, too. Moreover, other objects in our solar system also warrant a closer look: Venus, for instance, or Jupiter\u2019s moons. These objects reveal the potential composition of the different exoplanets. But don\u2019t we also need biologists and chemists if we want to investigate the origin of life? Yes, their expertise is also vital. In the last few years, considerable strides have been made in biochemistry and molecular chemistry as well. Today, biochemists can use computers to calculate completely new compounds and are able to simulate networks of chemical reactions. These networks probably served as catalysts for the origins of life. Geoscientists, too, are indispensable as they can tell us what conditions were like on Earth when life evolved.

The researchers expect that these samples will provide the needed details about the interior of the Martian moons that will enable more precise calculations of their origin. Another thing their calculations show is that the common ancestor of Phobos and Deimos was further away from Mars than Phobos is today. While the smaller Deimos has remained in the vicinity of where it came into being, tidal forces are causing the larger Phobos to approach Mars \u2013 and this process is ongoing, as the researchers explain. Their computer simulations also show the future development of the moons\u2019 orbits. It seems Deimos will move away from Mars very slowly, just as our Moon is slowly receding from Earth. Phobos, however, will crash into Mars in less than 40 million years or be torn apart by the gravitational forces as it nears Mars.

It covered a distance of 485 million kilometres at a speed of over 10,000 kilometres an hour. \u201cI am delighted and relieved that the landing has gone so smoothly,\u201d says Domenico Giardini, Professor of Geophysics and Seismology at ETH Zurich, who is responsible for the Swiss contribution to the InSight mission and followed the landing live in California.",

Today, biochemists can use computers to calculate completely new compounds and are able to simulate networks of chemical reactions.

The Professor of Seismology and Geophysics coordinates the activities at ETH for the InSight mission. Seismic signals recorded on Mars are relatively quiet and and therefore difficult to assess. Do they come from the wind? Were they a result of meteorite collisions? Or, are they in fact caused by geological processes inside the planet?

Another thing their calculations show is that the common ancestor of Phobos and Deimos was further away from Mars than Phobos is today. While the smaller Deimos has remained in the vicinity of where it came into being, tidal forces are causing the larger Phobos to approach Mars \u2013 and this process is ongoing, as the researchers explain.

The entire landing manoeuvre took just six minutes. The spacecraft was launched from California on 5 May 2018 on an Atlas V launch vehicle.

Mars is currently being explored by NASA\u2019s InSight mission, with ETH Zurich\u2019s involvement: the electronics for the mission\u2019s seismometer, which is recording marsquakes and possibly meteorite impacts, were built at ETH. \u201cThese recordings let us look inside the Red Planet,\u201d Khan says, \u201cand this data is used to constrain the Mars model in our calculations and the dissipation occurring inside the red planet.\u201d Images and measurements by other Mars probes have suggested that Phobos and Deimos are made of very porous material. At less than 2 grams per cubic centimetre, their density is much lower than the average density of Earth, which is 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre. \u201cThere are a lot of cavities inside Phobos, which might",

The researchers expect that these samples will provide the needed details about the interior of the Martian moons that will enable more precise calculations of their origin. Another thing their calculations show is that the common ancestor of Phobos and Deimos was further away from Mars than Phobos is today. While the smaller Deimos has remained in the vicinity of where it came into being, tidal forces are causing the larger Phobos to approach Mars \u2013 and this process is ongoing, as the researchers explain. Their computer simulations also show the future development of the moons\u2019 orbits. It seems Deimos will move away from Mars very slowly, just as our Moon is slowly receding from Earth. Phobos, however, will crash into Mars in less than 40 million years or be torn apart by the gravitational forces as it nears Mars.

Today, biochemists can use computers to calculate completely new compounds and are able to simulate networks of chemical reactions.

First, the researchers had to refine the existing theory describing the interaction between the moons and Mars. \u201cAll the celestial bodies exert tidal forces on each other,\u201d Khan explains. These forces lead to a form of energy conversion known as dissipation, the scale of which depends on the bodies\u2019 size, their interior composition and not least the distances between them. Mars is currently being explored by NASA\u2019s InSight mission, with ETH Zurich\u2019s involvement: the electronics for the mission\u2019s seismometer, which is recording marsquakes and possibly meteorite impacts, were built at ETH. \u201cThese recordings let us look inside the Red Planet,\u201d Khan says, \u201cand this data is used to constrain the Mars model in our calculations and the dissipation occurring inside the red planet.\u201d Images and measurements by other Mars probes have suggested that Phobos and Deimos are made of very porous material. At less than 2 grams per cubic centimetre, their density is much lower than the average density of Earth, which is 5.5 grams per cubic centimetre. \u201cThere are a lot of cavities inside Phobos, which might",

It construes the answer as 42, but the beings can\u2019t make sense of the number because they don\u2019t know exactly what the question was in the first place. Making values transparent: Numbers alone are meaningless. Only in situations that we can assess in the light of previous experience, where the risks are manageable and the consequences of various decisions known, may a number be sufficient \u2013 because the context is clear.

Surface solar radiation is a key parameter for climate issues.
